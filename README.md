# Checkout kata - bootstrap

This project contains a bootstrap for the resolution of the [checkout kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/). Feel free to fork it and start to resolve the code challenge.

:warning: The repository doesn't have the objetive to show the kata solution. At least on `master` (did you get it? :wink:).

## How to run the tests

```bash
$ bundle install
$ ruby -Itest test/checkout_test.rb
```
